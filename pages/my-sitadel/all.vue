    <p class="italic">In a Changing World.</p>

    <p>For this year’s student competition, we’re asking entrants to
      consider the theme In a Changing World.
      Our world is changing rapidly, and we are looking for
      photographers who can show us positive stories of development
      and progress. This could encapsulate a whole range of different
      topics; from the environment, to technology, to the way we work
      and live.</p>

    <p>You may wish to focus on how we have shifted working patterns
      and office set-ups, how we are responding to the climate crisis
      in a more conscientious way or even particular advancements
      in technology and research.</p>

    <p>In five to 10 images depict how you, or someone you document,
      are responding to the changes around them. Your images can
      be taken on any device, shot in any style – be black & white or
      colour – and approached from whichever angle you feel is best.
      While creative responses are encouraged, it’s key to stick to the
      brief.</p>

    <p>If your institution is not registered yet, you can register here. For
      information relating to this year’s brief or any other questions
      please email Panos Pomonis at panagiotis@worldphoto.org
